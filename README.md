# Hello-World
Welcome myself to Github :)

This is for training purposes. This repository helps me to familiarize with Github tools. Github turns out to be an amazing tool for keeping versions of 1 file/project. In other words, it helps with change management and make things easier for experimenting new ideas without messing up with the current-working version :). Whoever develops this tool is brilliant. Bravo to the team!
